Hello, I am Tylarz! I am an amateur web developer hoping to become an FSD (Full Stack Developer) someday.

I have been working on i18n **(internationalization)** on many open-source projects, and I've started a few projects of my own **(in pinned repositories)**.

I hope to make positive connections with people on the internet. I want to make this world a better place for everyone to live on.

- 🌎 I’m looking to collaborate on **localizing projects** and **programming**
  
- 👩‍💻 All of my projects are available [here](https://github.com/ds6?tab=repositories)  
  
- 📝 I sometimes write articles on [my blog!](https://tylarz.top)  
  
- 📫 How to reach me *i@tylarz.top*  
  
- ♉ Fun fact **I am a [Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(astrology))!**
